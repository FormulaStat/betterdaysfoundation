    <h2>Message from His Father</h2>
    <div class="message">
      <p>My Son,</p>
      <p>Your name was never a coincidence. It was a prophecy â€” a whisper from God into my spirit. <strong>Betterdays.</strong></p>
      <p>From the moment you arrived, light came into places I didnâ€™t even know were dark. Your tiny hands held my world together. Your laughter made silence holy. And though your time here was briefâ€¦ you changed everything.</p>
      <p>Losing you shattered me. There are no perfect words for the day you left. Only echoes. Only pain. Only a father standing in ruins, asking why.</p>
      <p>But I realized something in that emptiness: You didnâ€™t leave me with nothing.</p>
      <p>You left me with <strong>purpose</strong>. You left me with a <strong>mission</strong>. You left me with the voice to say: <em>"Even in the fire, something sacred can be born."</em></p>
      <p>So I created this foundation not out of strength, but out of surrender. To honor you. To help others find light in their own darkness. To show that <strong>Better Days</strong> are not gone â€” they are possible, because of you.</p>
      <p>You are not a memory, my son. You are a movement.</p>
      <p>â€” Your Father,<br/>Kasky James</p>

  <h2>His Story</h2>
  <div class="message">
    <p><strong>Betterdays</strong> was born on March 27, 2022 â€” a morning that felt like heaven touched earth.  
    He was named not just in hope, but in <em>prophecy</em>. A name chosen to carry light, no matter the darkness.</p>

    <p>From the moment he arrived, he brought a calm joy into his fatherâ€™s life. Every smile, every little gesture, every innocent noise from his tiny body felt like a miracle in motion.</p>

    <p>In just one year, Betterdays created more meaning than many do in decades. His presence softened grief, reminded us of what really matters, and planted something eternal in the heart of his father.</p>

    <p>On April 4, 2023, he returned to the heavens â€” quietly, peacefully, after a short illness. Though his time on earth was brief, his story is far from over.</p>

    <p>Because this foundation carries his name, his essence, his light â€” forward.  
    Not in mourning, but in <strong>movement</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Our Vision & Purpose</h2>
  <div class="message">
    <p>The Betterdays Foundation was born from grief â€” but it does not exist to mourn.  
    It exists to remind us all that pain can give birth to purpose, and that even the briefest life can spark eternal light.</p>

    <p>This foundation stands for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>ðŸ’› Healing</strong> â€” for fathers, mothers, and families who have lost but still love</li>
      <li><strong>ðŸŒ± Hope</strong> â€” for those walking through darkness, looking for meaning</li>
      <li><strong>ðŸ”¥ Legacy</strong> â€” because the names we carry and the stories we live must not be forgotten</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We believe that your story doesnâ€™t end with loss.  
    It continues with <strong>transformation</strong>.</p>

    <p>Through this space, we share, support, and build â€” all in the name of a little boy who reminded the world what truly matters.</p>

    <p>His name was <strong>Betterdays</strong>.  
    And through this foundation, <strong>better days will come.</strong></p>
