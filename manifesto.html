      <p><em>by James C. Izuchukwu (Jameskasky)</em></p>

      <p>I, James C. Izuchukwu, also known as Jameskasky, declare my intention to live a life of purpose, resilience, and transformation.</p>

      <p>I am not defined by what I lack, nor by what I’ve lost, but by the seeds I plant each day with truth, pain, and purpose. The storms I’ve faced are not punishments — they are awakenings. They have stripped me of illusion, purified my intentions, and revealed the strength of who I truly am.</p>

      <p>Through Betterdays Foundation, I choose to rebuild not just myself, but to become a bridge for others who are walking through their own fire. I will not hide my scars. They are my medals. My son, Betterdays, lives on — not just in memory, but in every step I take forward, in every life I impact, and in every truth I speak.</p>

      <p>This is my vow: to stand when it’s easier to fold. To build when the ground beneath me crumbles. To speak, write, and create as if the world depends on it — because for someone, it does.</p>

      <p>I honor the past, embrace the present, and claim the future. I may have been born in fire — but I am destined to rise in light.</p>
