    <h2>Message from His Father</h2>
    <div class="message">
      <p>My Son,</p>
      <p>Your name was never a coincidence. It was a prophecy — a whisper from God into my spirit. <strong>Betterdays.</strong></p>
      <p>From the moment you arrived, light came into places I didn’t even know were dark. Your tiny hands held my world together. Your laughter made silence holy. And though your time here was brief… you changed everything.</p>
      <p>Losing you shattered me. There are no perfect words for the day you left. Only echoes. Only pain. Only a father standing in ruins, asking why.</p>
      <p>But I realized something in that emptiness: You didn’t leave me with nothing.</p>
      <p>You left me with <strong>purpose</strong>. You left me with a <strong>mission</strong>. You left me with the voice to say: <em>"Even in the fire, something sacred can be born."</em></p>
      <p>So I created this foundation not out of strength, but out of surrender. To honor you. To help others find light in their own darkness. To show that <strong>Better Days</strong> are not gone — they are possible, because of you.</p>
      <p>You are not a memory, my son. You are a movement.</p>
      <p>— Your Father,<br/>Kasky James</p>
